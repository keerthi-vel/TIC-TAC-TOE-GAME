Approach:

For an empty array i used DOM-events to gather information from players and i used for-loop and if-else conditions to check win conditions, rotate turns and validate the winner among two players. 

Main features:

* User can customize their tokens.(symbols, letters, names)

* User can play right away with X and O tokens if they dont want to customize. 

* Visual Display of Winner.

* Used ripple effect for buttons,prompt for draw, moving images etc.

* Used grid,flexbox, setTimeout() function etc.

* Visual Effects to make it attractive and fun.


User Stories:

1. As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game.

2. As a user ,I(players) should be able to pick the names, symbols, numbers etc to play the game.

3. As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on.

4. As a user, I should be shown a message which player win, lose, or draw(tie game).

5. As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice.

6. As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie.

7. As a user, I should be able to play the game again by refreshing the page.
